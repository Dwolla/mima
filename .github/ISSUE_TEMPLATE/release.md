* [ ] [Draft a new release][releases/new] for the release, by [comparing changes][compare/view].
* [ ] Bump the version in the `README.md` and `git commit -m 'Release 0.x.y`
* [ ] Run `clean` in sbt, particularly if you've recently bumped `scalaVersion`.
* [ ] Run `git tag -a -s 0.x.y -m 'Version 0.x.y` and `git push --follow-tags`. The name of the tag should NOT have a 'v' prefix. Run `reload` and `show version` in sbt to verify the version.

* [ ] Wait for the artifacts to show up on Maven Central, either by:
  * successfully resolving the sbt plugin jar and dependent jars with sbt
