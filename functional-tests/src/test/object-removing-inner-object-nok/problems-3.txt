object A#B does not have a correspondent in new version
object A#B#C does not have a correspondent in new version
static field B in object A does not have a correspondent in new version
# in Scala 2 that field problem isn't emitted
# because the field never existed in the first place
# put different: Scala 3 adds a static final A$.B field
# which LGTM as it allows easier access for Java users to nested objects
